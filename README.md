### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ“« How to reach me: sav.vero@gmail.com
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently building small projects using React, Next.js and Vue to track my studying progress.

HI, I'm Veronique! I'm a a language enthusiast who naturally turned to programming. I believe that coding enables positive initiatives to be brought to reality.

I completed in 2018 a Full Stack Software Development bootcamp with Code Institute. Since then, I joined a number of empowering tech communities â€“ such as Diversein, Pyladies, Coding Grace, Ladies that UX, Girls in Tech â€“ and learned from insightful, enterprising women already in the industry. I joined Verizon Media in January 2019 (now Yahoo)  as a software engineering intern. As part of the Trust and Verification team, my focus is to limit ad fraud and to ensure relevant advertising content is provided to the consumers.

I have since moved into a Technical Project Management role, which is an amazing new challenge.

I relish the constant learning slope that comes with the ever-evolving programming languages and stacks. One thing I particularly enjoy is sharing the knowledge with budding tech geniuses, the ninjas of CoderDojo, when I volunteer at the Dogpatch Labs chapter. Because of COVID19 everything became digital, which changed things a little... When I am not in front of my screen, I am likely attending a meetup, drafting projects to promote diversity and inclusion, or reaching new heights (literally) on a bouldering wall.
